## 1. Minimum Dominating Set (minDominatingSet.py)

Calculates the Minimum Dominating Set in a given Graph

Sample Output:
Vertices in the Graph =  {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}
Edges in the Graph =  {(2, 7), (1, 2), (6, 9), (10, 4), (8, 2), (7, 1), (10, 7), (6, 8), (5, 6), (9, 3), (4, 5), (8, 10), (2, 3), (5, 1), (3, 4), (9, 7)}
Yellow Vertices =  {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 10}
Minimum Dominating Set (Red coloured) =  {8, 9, 5}
